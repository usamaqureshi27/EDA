# Exploratory Data Analysis 

# 1. Online Retail 

##  Purpose of the Project

In this project, I will be working with transactional data from an online retail store, to explore and analyze it to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products.

By conducting exploratory data analysis, I will identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, allowing to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, I will uncover key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. Ultimately, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.

## Analysis Approach
Main analysis approach after loading and cleaning the dataset will be:

- Perform data visualization to gain insights into the dataset. Generate appropriate plots, such as histograms, scatter plots, or bar plots, to visualize different aspects of the data.
- Analyze the sales trends over time. Identify the busiest months and days of the week in terms of sales.
- Explore the top-selling products and countries based on the quantity sold.
- Identify any outliers or anomalies in the dataset and discuss their potential impact on the analysis.
- Draw conclusions and summarize your findings from the exploratory data analysis.

# Dataset Used
is the "Online Retail" dataset which contains transactional data of an online retail store from 2010 to 2011. Courtesy to **Coursera** this data is publicly available [here](Data Files/Online Retail.xlsx)

# 2. Hotel Bookings

##  Purpose of the Project

In this project, I will be working with data from a hotel chain with its two main hotels, Resort Hotel and City Hotel, to explore and analyze it to gain insights into the reservation data.

By conducting exploratory data analysis, I will identify patterns in the cancellation and not cancellation of the reservation, allowing to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the hotel management to reduce cancellation rate. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, I will uncover key trends, such as the busiest reservations time and the hotels' daily rate impact on the final occupancy. Ultimately, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the final turn over of the hotels.

## Analysis Approach
Main analysis approach after loading and cleaning the dataset will be:

- Reservation status based upon hotel

- Reservation status based upon season

- Reservation status based upon country and market segment
